# Enhanced Student Addition with Subject Selection

## Overview

The Student Management System has been enhanced to properly handle subject assignments when adding new students. This addresses the issue where students were being added without proper subject selection and elective subject handling.

## Problem Solved

Previously, when adding a new student:
- ‚úÖ Student details were captured
- ‚úÖ Course was assigned
- ‚úÖ Profile was created
- ‚úÖ Fee record was initialized
- ‚ùå **Subject assignments were missing**
- ‚ùå **Elective subject selection was not handled**

## New Enhanced Flow

### 1. **Student Information Collection**
- Name, GR Number, Email, City, Mobile, Age
- All with proper validation

### 2. **Course Selection**
- Display available courses
- User selects course ID

### 3. **Subject Display and Selection**
- **Automatic retrieval** of subjects available for the selected course
- **Separation** of mandatory and elective subjects
- **Clear visual distinction** between subject types

### 4. **Mandatory Subject Handling**
- **Auto-selection** of all mandatory subjects
- **No user input required** for mandatory subjects
- **Clear feedback** showing which subjects were auto-selected

### 5. **Elective Subject Selection**
- **Optional selection** of elective subjects
- **Comma-separated input** for multiple selections
- **Validation** of selected subject IDs
- **Clear feedback** for each selection

### 6. **Database Operations**
- **Transaction-based** insertion for data integrity
- **Student record** creation
- **Profile record** creation
- **Course assignment** creation
- **Fee record** initialization
- **Subject assignments** creation (multiple records)

## Database Schema Integration

The enhanced system properly works with your database schema:

```sql
-- Student gets added to students table
INSERT INTO students (name, gr_number, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?);

-- Profile gets added to profiles table  
INSERT INTO profiles (student_id, city, mobile_no, age) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?);

-- Course assignment gets added to student_courses table
INSERT INTO student_courses (student_id, course_id) VALUES (?, ?);

-- Fee record gets added to fees table
INSERT INTO fees (student_course_id, paid_amount, pending_amount, total_fee) VALUES (?, 0.0, ?, ?);

-- Subject assignments get added to student_subjects table
INSERT INTO student_subjects (student_course_id, subject_course_id) VALUES (?, ?);
```

## User Interface Example

```
üìö Available Subjects for Course ID 1:
================================================================================
üî¥ MANDATORY SUBJECTS (Must select all):
   ID: 1   | Programming Fundamentals                    | Type: mandatory
   ID: 3   | Data Structures                             | Type: mandatory

üü¢ ELECTIVE SUBJECTS (Optional):
   ID: 2   | Business Communication                      | Type: elective

üî¥ Selecting Mandatory Subjects:
   ‚úì Auto-selected: Programming Fundamentals
   ‚úì Auto-selected: Data Structures

üü¢ Select Elective Subjects:
Enter elective subject IDs (comma-separated, or press Enter to skip): 2
   ‚úì Selected: Business Communication

Student added successfully with 3 subjects assigned.
```
