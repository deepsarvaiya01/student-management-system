# Enhanced Student Addition with Immediate Fee Payment

## Overview

The Student Management System has been further enhanced to include an **immediate fee payment option** when adding new students. After successful student registration with subject assignments, the system now asks if the student wants to pay fees immediately, providing a seamless registration and payment experience.

## New Feature: Immediate Fee Payment

### **What's New**

When a new student is successfully added to the system, the application now:

1. âœ… **Completes student registration** with all details, course, and subjects
2. âœ… **Shows success message** for student creation
3. âœ… **Prompts for immediate fee payment** with a clear option
4. âœ… **Processes fee payment** if the student chooses to pay
5. âœ… **Updates fee records** and shows updated status
6. âœ… **Provides fallback option** to pay later if declined
